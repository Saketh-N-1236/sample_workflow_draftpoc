# Requirements for Test Repository Analysis
# Minimal dependencies - most functionality uses Python standard library

# Enhanced AST parsing (optional, for better docstring extraction)
# ast-comments>=1.1.3  # Uncomment if needed for advanced parsing

# Note: This project primarily uses Python's built-in modules:
# - ast (Abstract Syntax Tree parsing)
# - pathlib (File path handling)
# - json (JSON file operations)
# - re (Regular expressions)
# - datetime (Timestamp generation)

# All other dependencies are part of Python standard library (3.7+)
